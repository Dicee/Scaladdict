Scaladdict
==========

A little interpreter of a simplified Java-like language, written in Scala. This was my first use of Scala and just a way
to manipulate some stuff I had read about.

This language only supports :

- declaration and assignment of double variables
- display of strings, chars, booleans and double variables
- classic for loops (no iterators)
- while loops
- if, else if, else clauses
- switch clauses
